# Multi-Role Authentication System Architecture

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the comprehensive multi-role authentication system design for the Astral Turf Soccer Management Application. The system will extend the existing authentication framework to support three distinct user types: **COACHES**, **PLAYERS**, and **FAMILY MEMBERS**, each with role-specific features and access controls.

## Current System Analysis

### Existing Authentication Structure
- **User Model**: Simple structure with `id`, `email`, `role` ('coach' | 'player'), and optional `playerId`
- **Auth Service**: Mock authentication with localStorage-based session management
- **Auth State**: Basic authentication state with user object and error handling
- **Protected Routes**: Simple authentication check without role-based access control
- **Demo Data**: Limited to 4 demo users (1 coach, 3 players)

### Current Pages and Features
The application currently has 26+ pages covering comprehensive soccer management:
- Dashboard, Tactics Board, Training, Transfers, Analytics
- Staff, Stadium, Sponsorships, Youth Academy
- Medical Center, Press Conference, Player Profiles
- News Feed, Club History, Board Objectives

## Multi-Role Architecture Design

### 1. Enhanced User and Role System

#### Extended User Interface
```typescript
export interface User {
  id: string;
  email: string;
  role: 'coach' | 'player' | 'family';
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
  profileImage?: string;
  
  // Role-specific associations
  playerId?: string;        // For players and family members
  coachId?: string;         // For coach associations
  familyMemberIds?: string[]; // For players - their family members
  playerIds?: string[];     // For family members - their associated players
  
  // Settings and preferences
  notifications: NotificationSettings;
  timezone: string;
  language: string;
  
  // Account metadata
  createdAt: string;
  lastLoginAt?: string;
  isActive: boolean;
  needsPasswordReset?: boolean;
}
```

#### Family Member Association System
```typescript
export interface FamilyMemberAssociation {
  id: string;
  familyMemberId: string;
  playerId: string;
  relationship: 'mother' | 'father' | 'guardian' | 'sibling' | 'other';
  permissions: FamilyPermissions;
  approvedByCoach: boolean;
  createdAt: string;
}

export interface FamilyPermissions {
  canViewStats: boolean;
  canViewSchedule: boolean;
  canViewMedical: boolean;
  canCommunicateWithCoach: boolean;
  canViewFinancials: boolean;
  canReceiveNotifications: boolean;
}
```

### 2. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

#### Permission Matrix

| Feature Category | Coach | Player | Family |
|-----------------|-------|--------|--------|
| **Team Management** | Full | View Own | View Child |
| **Player Statistics** | All Players | Own Only | Child Only |
| **Training Schedules** | Create/Edit | View/Respond | View Child |
| **Medical Records** | All Players | Own Only | Child Only |
| **Financial Data** | Team Budget | Own Contract | Child Fees |
| **Communication** | All | Coach/Team | Coach Only |
| **Match Analysis** | Full Access | Own Performance | Child Performance |
| **Transfers** | Full Control | View Interest | View Child |

#### Route Protection System
```typescript
export interface RoutePermission {
  path: string;
  allowedRoles: UserRole[];
  requiredPermissions?: string[];
  fallbackPath?: string;
}

export const ROUTE_PERMISSIONS: RoutePermission[] = [
  {
    path: '/dashboard',
    allowedRoles: ['coach', 'player', 'family'],
  },
  {
    path: '/tactics',
    allowedRoles: ['coach'],
    fallbackPath: '/dashboard'
  },
  {
    path: '/player-profile/:playerId',
    allowedRoles: ['coach', 'player', 'family'],
    requiredPermissions: ['canViewPlayer']
  },
  // ... more route definitions
];
```
